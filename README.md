For this project, I'm building a trip-planning web application using the Geocoding API of MapBox and the Trip Planning API from Winnipeg Transit.

This will only work for Buses in the province of Winnipeg.

If the 'No trips data is available' message popup chances are it's late at night so there will not be any bus route available.

How to use:
1. Input the origin of where you want to start 
2. Select one of the suggested routes
3. Input your destination
4. Select one of the suggested routes
5. Select 'Plan My Trip'
6. Check the displayed route
