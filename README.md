For this project, Im building a trip planning application using the Geocoding API of MapBox and the Trip Planning API from Winnipeg Transit.

There are 3 main components to the trip planning application:
1. Selecting the origin (or starting location)
2. Selecting the destination
3. Displaying the planned trip
